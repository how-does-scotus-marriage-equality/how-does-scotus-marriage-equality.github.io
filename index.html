        <h1>How Does The SCOTUS Marriage Equality Ruling Affect You?</h1>
      
        <p>On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled on the case
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges">Obergefell v. Hodges</a>. 
        This 5-4 ruling overturned the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
      
        <p>However, <a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/preview/1605/desktop/?das">the full text of a legal ruling</a>
        such as this can be very difficult to understand.</p>
      
        <h2>You probably have questions, such as:</h2>
      
        <ul>
            <li>Will I be forced to gay marry someone?</li>
            <li>If my church doesn't officiate a gay wedding, will it be burned to the ground, and will its ashes be used in a demon summoning ritual?</li>
            <li>Should I start buying gold and hoarding freeze-dried food in preparation for the End Times?</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>Dear reader, fear not! I will spell out for you <em>exactly</em> how this ruling will affect your life.
        I just need you to answer a few simple questions. Sound good? Let's begin.</p>
        
        <h2>Question #1: Are you heterosexual?</h2>
